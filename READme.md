# Overview

To further my learning I spent a lot of time in the past few weeks working on learning how to code better with Java. I learned a lot about the language and how to use it.

The program that asks the user for an input of genre, rating, actor, composer, and duration that they like and outputs different movies that the user could watch.

I wrote this software so that I can have a program that I can modify and add more movies/genres to so that when I am looking for a movie to watch I can find one quickly. I also want to be able to modify it more in the future so it works better and is a lot longer.

# Development Environment
I used Java to create my program and the Java.util library.
